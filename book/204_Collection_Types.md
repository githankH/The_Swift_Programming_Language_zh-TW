# 聚集型態
---
Swift支援兩種*聚集型態*, 像已知的陣列型態以及字典型態,給予容器將值聚集儲存。陣列型態以序列方式儲存相同資料型態的資料。字典型態以無序列方式儲存相同資料型態的資料，它可以使用唯一的識別字從頭到尾尋找並將值取出(但必須知道它的識別字).

陣列型態以及字典型態在Swift總是清楚關於型態值和識別字怎麼儲存，意思是你無法加入錯誤的資料型態在陣列或是字典中。也意味著你可以確信型態和值可以復取在陣列或是字典中。
Swift使用顯示類型聚集確保你的程式碼清楚於型態與值可以工作以及使你早點抓取任何不匹配的型態在你開發程式時。

## Arrays

An *array* stores multiple values of the same type in an ordered list. The same value can appear in an array multiple times at different positions.

Swift arrays are specific about the kinds of values they can store. They differ from Objective-C’s `NSArray` and `NSMutableArray` classes, which can store any kind of object and do not provide any information about the nature of the objects they return. In Swift, the type of values that a particular array can store is always made clear, either through an explicit type annotation, or through type inference, and does not have to be a class type. If you create an array of `Int` values, for example, you can’t insert any value other than `Int` values into that array. Swift arrays are type safe, and are always clear about what they may contain.

### Array Type Shorthand Syntax

The type of a Swift array is written in full as `Array<SomeType>`, where `SomeType` is the type that the array is allowed to store. You can also write the type of an array in shorthand form as `SomeType[]`. Although the two forms are functionally identical, the shorthand form is preferred, and is used throughout this guide when referring to the type of an array.

### Array Literals

You can initialize an array with an *array literal*, which is a shorthand way to write one or more values as an array collection. An array literal is written as a list of values, separated by commas, surrounded by a pair of square brackets:

```swift
[value 1, value 2, value 3]
```

The example below creates an array called `shoppingList` to store `String` values:

```swift
var shoppingList: String[] = ["Eggs", "Milk"]
// shoppingList has been initialized with two initial items
```

The `shoppingList` variable is declared as “an array of `String` values”, written as `String[]`. Because this particular array has specified a value type of `String`, it is only allowed to store `String` values. Here, the `shoppingList` array is initialized with two `String` values (`"Eggs"` and `"Milk"`), written within an array literal.

> **NOTE**
> 
> The `shoppingList` array is declared as a variable (with the `var` introducer) and not a constant (with the `let` introducer) because more items are added to the shopping list in the examples below.

In this case, the array literal contains two `String` values and nothing else. This matches the type of the `shoppingList` variable’s declaration (an array that can only contain `String` values), and so the assignment of the array literal is permitted as a way to initialize `shoppingList` with two initial items.

Thanks to Swift’s type inference, you don’t have to write the type of the array if you’re initializing it with an array literal containing values of the same type. The initialization of `shoppingList` could have been written in a shorter form instead:

```swift
var shoppingList = ["Eggs", "Milk"]
```

Because all values in the array literal are of the same type, Swift can infer that `String[]` is the correct type to use for the `shoppingList` variable.

### Accessing and Modifying an Array

You access and modify an array through its methods and properties, or by using subscript syntax.

To find out the number of items in an array, check its read-only `count` property:

```swift
println("The shopping list contains \(shoppingList.count) items.")
// prints "The shopping list contains 2 items."
```

Use the Boolean `isEmpty` property as a shortcut for checking whether the `count` property is equal to `0`:

```swift
if shoppingList.isEmpty {
    println("The shopping list is empty.")
} else {
    println("The shopping list is not empty.")
}
// prints "The shopping list is not empty."
```

You can add a new item to the end of an array by calling the array’s `append` method:

```swift
shoppingList.append("Flour")
// shoppingList now contains 3 items, and someone is making pancakes
```

Alternatively, add a new item to the end of an array with the addition assignment operator (`+=`):

```swift
shoppingList += "Baking Powder"
// shoppingList now contains 4 items
```

You can also append an array of compatible items with the addition assignment operator (`+=`):

```swift
shoppingList += ["Chocolate Spread", "Cheese", "Butter"]
// shoppingList now contains 7 items
```

Retrieve a value from the array by using *subscript syntax*, passing the index of the value you want to retrieve within square brackets immediately after the name of the array:

```swift
var firstItem = shoppingList[0]
// firstItem is equal to "Eggs"
```

Note that the first item in the array has an index of `0`, not `1`. Arrays in Swift are always zero-indexed.

You can use subscript syntax to change an existing value at a given index:

```swift
shoppingList[0] = "Six eggs"
// the first item in the list is now equal to "Six eggs" rather than "Eggs"
```

You can also use subscript syntax to change a range of values at once, even if the replacement set of values has a different length than the range you are replacing. The following example replaces `"Chocolate Spread"`, `"Cheese"`, and `"Butter"` with `"Bananas"` and `"Apples"`:

```swift
shoppingList[4...6] = ["Bananas", "Apples"]
// shoppingList now contains 6 items
```

> **NOTE**
> 
> You can’t use subscript syntax to append a new item to the end of an array. If you try to use subscript syntax to retrieve or set a value for an index that is outside of an array’s existing bounds, you will trigger a runtime error. However, you can check that an index is valid before using it, by comparing it to the array’s `count` property. Except when `count` is `0` (meaning the array is empty), the largest valid index in an array will always be `count - 1`, because arrays are indexed from zero.

To insert an item into the array at a specified index, call the array’s `insert(atIndex:)` method:

```swift
shoppingList.insert("Maple Syrup", atIndex: 0)
// shoppingList now contains 7 items
// "Maple Syrup" is now the first item in the list
```

This call to the `insert` method inserts a new item with a value of `"Maple Syrup"` at the very beginning of the shopping list, indicated by an index of `0`.

Similarly, you remove an item from the array with the `removeAtIndex` method. This method removes the item at the specified index and returns the removed item (although you can ignore the returned value if you do not need it):

```swift
let mapleSyrup = shoppingList.removeAtIndex(0)
// the item that was at index 0 has just been removed
// shoppingList now contains 6 items, and no Maple Syrup
// the mapleSyrup constant is now equal to the removed "Maple Syrup" string
```

Any gaps in an array are closed when an item is removed, and so the value at index `0` is once again equal to `"Six eggs"`:

```swift
firstItem = shoppingList[0]
// firstItem is now equal to "Six eggs"
```

If you want to remove the final item from an array, use the `removeLast` method rather than the `removeAtIndex` method to avoid the need to query the array’s `count` property. Like the `removeAtIndex` method, `removeLast` returns the removed item:

```swift
let apples = shoppingList.removeLast()
// the last item in the array has just been removed
// shoppingList now contains 5 items, and no cheese
// the apples constant is now equal to the removed "Apples" string
```

### Iterating Over an Array

You can iterate over the entire set of values in an array with the `for`-`in` loop:

```swift
for item in shoppingList {
    println(item)
}
// Six eggs
// Milk
// Flour
// Baking Powder
// Bananas
```

If you need the integer index of each item as well as its value, use the global `enumerate` function to iterate over the array instead. The `enumerate` function returns a tuple for each item in the array composed of the index and the value for that item. You can decompose the tuple into temporary constants or variables as part of the iteration:

```swift
for (index, value) in enumerate(shoppingList) {
    println("Item \(index + 1): \(value)")
}
// Item 1: Six eggs
// Item 2: Milk
// Item 3: Flour
// Item 4: Baking Powder
// Item 5: Bananas
```

For more about the `for`-`in` loop, see [For Loops](205_Control_Flow.html#for-loops "For Loops").

### Creating and Initializing an Array

You can create an empty array of a certain type (without setting any initial values) using initializer syntax:

```swift
var someInts = Int[]()
println("someInts is of type Int[] with \(someInts.count) items.")
// prints "someInts is of type Int[] with 0 items."
```

Note that the type of the `someInts` variable is inferred to be `Int[]`, because it is set to the output of an `Int[]` initializer.

Alternatively, if the context already provides type information, such as a function argument or an already-typed variable or constant, you can create an empty array with an empty array literal, which is written as `[]` (an empty pair of square brackets):

```swift
someInts.append(3)
// someInts now contains 1 value of type Int
someInts = []
// someInts is now an empty array, but is still of type Int[]
```

Swift’s `Array` type also provides an initializer for creating an array of a certain size with all of its values set to a provided default value. You pass this initializer the number of items to be added to the new array (called `count`) and a default value of the appropriate type (called `repeatedValue`):

```swift
var threeDoubles = Double[](count: 3, repeatedValue: 0.0)
// threeDoubles is of type Double[], and equals [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
```

Thanks to type inference, you don’t need to specify the type to be stored in the array when using this initializer, because it can be inferred from the default value:

```swift
var anotherThreeDoubles = Array(count: 3, repeatedValue: 2.5)
// anotherThreeDoubles is inferred as Double[], and equals [2.5, 2.5, 2.5]
```

Finally, you can create a new array by adding together two existing arrays of compatible type with the addition operator (`+`). The new array’s type is inferred from the type of the two arrays you add together:

```swift
var sixDoubles = threeDoubles + anotherThreeDoubles
// sixDoubles is inferred as Double[], and equals [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 2.5, 2.5, 2.5]
```

## Dictionaries

A *dictionary* is a container that stores multiple values of the same type. Each value is associated with a unique key, which acts as an identifier for that value within the dictionary. Unlike items in an array, items in a dictionary do not have a specified order. You use a dictionary when you need to look up values based on their identifier, in much the same way that a real-world dictionary is used to look up the definition for a particular word.

Swift dictionaries are specific about the types of keys and values they can store. They differ from Objective-C’s `NSDictionary` and `NSMutableDictionary` classes, which can use any kind of object as their keys and values and do not provide any information about the nature of these objects. In Swift, the type of keys and values that a particular dictionary can store is always made clear, either through an explicit type annotation or through type inference.

Swift’s dictionary type is written as `Dictionary<KeyType, ValueType>`, where `KeyType` is the type of value that can be used as a dictionary key, and `ValueType` is the type of value that the dictionary stores for those keys.

The only restriction is that `KeyType` must be hashable—that is, it must provide a way to make itself uniquely representable. All of Swift’s basic types (such as `String`, `Int`, `Double`, and `Bool`) are hashable by default, and all of these types can be used as the keys of a dictionary. Enumeration member values without associated values (as described in [Enumerations]()) are also hashable by default.

### Dictionary Literals

You can initialize a dictionary with with a *dictionary literal*, which has a similar syntax to the array literal seen earlier. A dictionary literal is a shorthand way to write one or more key-value pairs as a `Dictionary` collection.

A *key-value pair* is a combination of a key and a value. In a dictionary literal, the key and value in each key-value pair are separated by a colon. The key-value pairs are written as a list, separated by commas, surrounded by a pair of square brackets:

```swift
[key 1: value 1, key 2: value 2, key 3: value 3]`
```

The example below creates a dictionary to store the names of international airports. In this dictionary, the keys are three-letter International Air Transport Association codes, and the values are airport names:

```swift
var airports: Dictionary<String, String> = ["TYO": "Tokyo", "DUB": "Dublin"]
```

The `airports` dictionary is declared as having a type of `Dictionary<String, String>`, which means “a `Dictionary` whose keys are of type `String`, and whose values are also of type `String`”.

> **NOTE**
> 
> The `airports` dictionary is declared as a variable (with the `var` introducer), and not a constant (with the `let` introducer), because more airports will be added to the dictionary in the examples below.

The `airports` dictionary is initialized with a dictionary literal containing two key-value pairs. The first pair has a key of `"TYO"` and a value of `"Tokyo"`. The second pair has a key of `"DUB"` and a value of `"Dublin"`.

This dictionary literal contains two `String: String` pairs. This matches the type of the `airports` variable declaration (a dictionary with only `String` keys, and only `String` values) and so the assignment of the dictionary literal is permitted as a way to initialize the `airports` dictionary with two initial items.

As with arrays, you don’t have to write the type of the dictionary if you’re initializing it with a dictionary literal whose keys and values have consistent types. The initialization of `airports` could have been be written in a shorter form instead:

```swift
var airports = ["TYO": "Tokyo", "DUB": "Dublin"]
```

Because all keys in the literal are of the same type as each other, and likewise all values are of the same type as each other, Swift can infer that `Dictionary<String, String>` is the correct type to use for the `airports` dictionary.

### Accessing and Modifying a Dictionary

You access and modify a dictionary through its methods and properties, or by using subscript syntax. As with an array, you can find out the number of items in a `Dictionary` by checking its read-only `count` property:

```swift
println("The dictionary of airports contains \(airports.count) items.")
// prints "The dictionary of airports contains 2 items."
```

You can add a new item to a dictionary with subscript syntax. Use a new key of the appropriate type as the subscript index, and assign a new value of the appropriate type:

```swift
airports["LHR"] = "London"
// the airports dictionary now contains 3 items
```

You can also use subscript syntax to change the value associated with a particular key:

```swift
airports["LHR"] = "London Heathrow"
// the value for "LHR" has been changed to "London Heathrow"
```

As an alternative to subscripting, use a dictionary’s `updateValue(forKey:)` method to set or update the value for a particular key. Like the subscript examples above, the `updateValue(forKey:)` method sets a value for a key if none exists, or updates the value if that key already exists. Unlike a subscript, however, the `updateValue(forKey:)` method returns the *old* value after performing an update. This enables you to check whether or not an update took place.

The `updateValue(forKey:)` method returns an optional value of the dictionary’s value type. For a dictionary that stores `String` values, for example, the method returns a value of type `String?`, or “optional `String`”. This optional value contains the old value for that key if one existed before the update, or `nil` if no value existed:

```swift
if let oldValue = airports.updateValue("Dublin International", forKey: "DUB") {
    println("The old value for DUB was \(oldValue).")
}
// prints "The old value for DUB was Dublin."
```

You can also use subscript syntax to retrieve a value from the dictionary for a particular key. Because it is possible to request a key for which no value exists, a dictionary’s subscript returns an optional value of the dictionary’s value type. If the dictionary contains a value for the requested key, the subscript returns an optional value containing the existing value for that key. Otherwise, the subscript returns `nil`:

```swift
if let airportName = airports["DUB"] {
    println("The name of the airport is \(airportName).")
} else {
    println("That airport is not in the airports dictionary.")
}
// prints "The name of the airport is Dublin International."
```

You can use subscript syntax to remove a key-value pair from a dictionary by assigning a value of `nil` for that key:

```swift
airports["APL"] = "Apple International"
// "Apple International" is not the real airport for APL, so delete it
airports["APL"] = nil
// APL has now been removed from the dictionary
```

Alternatively, remove a key-value pair from a dictionary with the `removeValueForKey` method. This method removes the key-value pair if it exists and returns the removed value, or returns `nil` if no value existed:

```swift
if let removedValue = airports.removeValueForKey("DUB") {
    println("The removed airport's name is \(removedValue).")
} else {
    println("The airports dictionary does not contain a value for DUB.")
}
// prints "The removed airport's name is Dublin International."
```

### Iterating Over a Dictionary

You can iterate over the key-value pairs in a dictionary with a `for`-`in` loop. Each item in the dictionary is returned as a `(key, value)` tuple, and you can decompose the tuple’s members into temporary constants or variables as part of the iteration:

```swift
for (airportCode, airportName) in airports {
    println("\(airportCode): \(airportName)")
}
// TYO: Tokyo
// LHR: London Heathrow
```

For more about the `for`-`in` loop, see [For Loops](205_Control_Flow.html#for-loops "For Loops").

You can also retrieve an iteratable collection of a dictionary’s keys or values by accessing its `keys` and `values` properties:

```swift
for airportCode in airports.keys {
    println("Airport code: \(airportCode)")
}
// Airport code: TYO
// Airport code: LHR
 
for airportName in airports.values {
    println("Airport name: \(airportName)")
}
// Airport name: Tokyo
// Airport name: London Heathrow
```

If you need to use a dictionary’s keys or values with an API that takes an `Array` instance, initialize a new array with the `keys` or `values` property:

```swift
let airportCodes = Array(airports.keys)
// airportCodes is ["TYO", "LHR"]
 
let airportNames = Array(airports.values)
// airportNames is ["Tokyo", "London Heathrow"]
```

> **NOTE**
> 
> Swift’s `Dictionary` type is an unordered collection. The order in which keys, values, and key-value pairs are retrieved when iterating over a dictionary is not specified.

### Creating an Empty Dictionary

As with arrays, you can create an empty `Dictionary` of a certain type by using initializer syntax:

```swift
var namesOfIntegers = Dictionary<Int, String>()
// namesOfIntegers is an empty Dictionary<Int, String>
```

This example creates an empty dictionary of type `Int`, `String` to store human-readable names of integer values. Its keys are of type `Int`, and its values are of type `String`.

If the context already provides type information, create an empty dictionary with an empty dictionary literal, which is written as `[:]` (a colon inside a pair of square brackets):

```swift
namesOfIntegers[16] = "sixteen"
// namesOfIntegers now contains 1 key-value pair
namesOfIntegers = [:]
// namesOfIntegers is once again an empty dictionary of type Int, String
```

> **NOTE**
> 
> Behind the scenes, Swift’s array and dictionary types are implemented as *generic collections*. For more on generic types and collections, see [Generics]().

## Mutability of Collections

Arrays and dictionaries store multiple values together in a single collection. If you create an array or a dictionary and assign it to a variable, the collection that is created will be *mutable*. This means that you can change (or *mutate*) the size of the collection after it is created by adding more items to the collection, or by removing existing items from the ones it already contains. Conversely, if you assign an array or a dictionary to a constant, that array or dictionary is *immutable*, and its size cannot be changed.

For dictionaries, immutability also means that you cannot replace the value for an existing key in the dictionary. An immutable dictionary’s contents cannot be changed once they are set.

Immutability has a slightly different meaning for arrays, however. You are still not allowed to perform any action that has the potential to change the size of an immutable array, but you are allowed to set a new value for an existing index in the array. This enables Swift’s `Array` type to provide optimal performance for array operations when the size of an array is fixed.

The mutability behavior of Swift’s `Array` type also affects how array instances are assigned and modified. For more information, see [Assignment and Copy Behavior for Collection Types]().

> **NOTE**
> 
> It is good practice to create immutable collections in all cases where the collection’s size does not need to change. Doing so enables the Swift compiler to optimize the performance of the collections you create.
